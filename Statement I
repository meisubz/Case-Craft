# Product Teardown Competition - Lending & Credit Product for INDmoney  
*Hosted (Online) by: IIM Visakhapatnam via Unstop*  

## Overview
As part of the **Product Teardown Competition** hosted on Unstop by IIM Visakhapatnam, I formulated a 3-slider solution for building a powerful lending product for INDmoney, leveraging user data. Below is the breakdown of the approach I took across three key areas: Product Development, Roadmap, and Go-to-Market Strategy.

## Solution Overview
In the competition, the problem statement was: *How would you build a powerful and elegant lending product for users at INDmoney, leveraging users’ information?* I structured my solution by addressing the following questions:

### 1. **Product Development**
I proposed the following key features for the lending product:

#### **Lending Dashboard**
The **Lending Dashboard** would serve as the central hub for managing all loan-related activities. It would be the primary interface through which users could access the product’s core features.

#### **Core Features**
- **Goal-Based Loans**: By analyzing transaction trends, the system would predict borrowing needs (e.g., for education, marriage) and allow users to manually create custom goals. 
- **Dynamic Credit Line**: Credit limits would be dynamically revised based on users' past financial behavior and immediate future goals, ensuring the product stays relevant as users’ financial needs evolve.
- **Personalized Loan Offers**: AI would analyze user data such as income, expenses, and financial history to deliver tailored, pre-approved loan offers that meet each user’s unique needs.
- **Personalized User Insights**: AI-driven recommendations would be provided to users, offering actionable financial tips based on their financial data analysis, helping them make informed decisions about loans and credit usage.

### 2. **Phase-Wise Roadmap**
The roadmap was designed to launch the product iteratively, focusing on key features for the MVP:

#### **MVP Definition**
The **MVP** would focus on:
- The **Lending Dashboard**.
- **Goal-Based Loans**.
- **Personalized Loan Offers** using basic AI.
- **Dynamic Credit Line**.

### 3. **Go-to-Market Strategy**
To successfully position and launch the product, the strategy would focus on both driving adoption among existing users (2M+ on INDmoney) and acquiring new users:

#### **Acquiring New Users**
- **Referral Programs**: Incentivize current users to invite new users by offering loan benefits or discounts.
- **Targeted Digital Ads**: Use data analytics to run ads targeting individuals based on demographic and behavioral patterns (e.g., young professionals, students).

#### **Driving Adoption Among Existing Users**
- **In-app Notifications**: Leverage existing user engagement tools to notify users about personalized loan offers, encouraging them to take advantage of the new features.
- **User Onboarding**: Develop an easy onboarding process with a tutorial to walk users through the features of the Lending Dashboard.

## Conclusion
Though I did not qualify for the second round, this exercise allowed me to showcase my product management skills by designing a comprehensive solution for a complex problem. The formulation of a dynamic, personalized lending product would help INDmoney leverage its existing user base and data to offer valuable, tailored financial services.
